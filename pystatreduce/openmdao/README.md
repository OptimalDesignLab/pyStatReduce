The following directory contains a template for how stochastic collocation and
dimension reduction can be implemented within the OpenMDAO framework. The current
implementation (as of this commit) does not use the OpenMDAO framework, but the
hope is that this package will eventually be converted to it.

Once the package has been converted there will be no need for this directory, and
can be safely deleted.
